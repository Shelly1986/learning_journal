I am Shelly Sachdev. I am a Computer Science/ICT teacher from India. My journey so far has been amazing and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. All my experience since 2010 has been with the Middle and Secondary School students and during these 12 years, I have had the pleasure of teaching in three different countries.

My journey of being an educator started in India where I taught IB and Cambridge courses, and it was such a gratifying experience. From India to China and then to Poland, it was a big leap of faith with huge challenges pertaining to meeting expectations in a new professional environment and accepting a new home away from home every time I moved countries.

Over these years, I have gained experience in dealing with a diverse group of learners across age groups 11 - 18. I love teaching Computer Science because of the fact that I get to teach a variety of topics such as Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Scratch, Office suite, Blender, Adobe Photoshop and so much more. The age range and variety has really helped me develop a range of skills over these years.

In my free time, I love to watch documentaries on Netflix, write short poems, read non-fiction books and meditating. However, practicing phonics and coloring with my toddler tops the list.

I am a huge advocate of Education Technology and I have been a part of a number of Microsoft training campaigns where I have led trainings in a number of schools in India. I would love to explore this area further in my professional career as a teacher.

This portfolio is a work in progress and I have added a few Python and Javascript projects I have done with my students. I will keep adding more activities to this space as I tread the path of lifelong learning.
